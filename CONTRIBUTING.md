# How To Contribute

All contributions are welcome!

# Languages

Please use Czech for name, description and comments in every issue and pull request. All sources (also with README and this file) and commit messages have to be in English.

# How to submit an issue

There are no specific rules for creating an issue. Please, spend some time on a good issue name and description...

# How to submit a pull request

Please use the following format for a branch name: `{feature,bugfix,content}/slug`. All requests should be reviewed by another person (it's necessary to be a team member for making reviews) and it's recommended to provide some short description of requested changes.

You can create a pull request as a draft and see a deployed blog preview with your changes. Some team member will make a review once the pull request is "ready for review" or it is possible to ask someone directly. 

We are trying to keep clean git history so it's highly recommended to clean branch history using interactive rebase. Suggested changes will be merged after the review.
